<blockquote class="au-no-left-border"></blockquote><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><div>According to the National Disaster  Management Authority (NDMA), one of Pakistan's worst floods, triggered by  exceptionally heavy monsoon rains, affected around 33 million people nationwide.  During floods, itâ€™s necessary to gather observations from the disaster site,  and these observations are used to create flood-level maps to aid in emergency  operations. People in flooded areas shared text and images on Social media  platforms to show the current situation. In this paper, we suggested a mask R-CNN model-based  approach to predict flood water levels on images collected from social media. We  face these challenges i) the size of the object that appears in the image is  unknown ii) There may be variations in the height of the flood water that  appears in various parts of the image, and iii) the objects that may be  submerged in water are partially visible. We addressed these issues by  identifying class objects with known sizes to estimate water levels. We train  the Mask R-CNN model on the flood-water dataset and then finally check the  ability of the train model on collected images from real-time flood areas. The  Mask-RCNN model achieved 0.85 accuracy in detecting submerged objects with an  error margin of just 0.15 cm in water level estimation.</div></blockquote><div>&nbsp;</div>
