<div><b>1.Introduction</b></div><div><b></b>Due to the impacts of global climate  change, floods are expected to increase in both frequency and severity, leading  to greater potential damage [14]. Flooding is a significant environmental  challenge in Pakistan, which has experienced numerous floods from 1973 to 2022,  with some of the most severe occurrences in recent years. In August 2022, Pakistan  experienced one of the most devastating floods in its history, driven by  exceptionally heavy monsoon rains that impacted around 33 million people  nationwide. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported that  these floods led to 211 fatalities, 294 injuries, the destruction of nearly  4,000 homes, and the loss of over 1,100 livestock additionally, agricultural  losses in the most productive Indus plains have exacerbated the risk of food  insecurity in the country [15].</div><div>To decrease human  death, accurate maps of flood areas are  essential for effectively planning rescue operations. Real-time,  scattered data about flood water levels from the disaster area must be obtained  to create such maps. There are several drawbacks to  routine monitoring methods including field data gathering, remote sensing, and  stream gauging. For  example, satellite-based remote sensing data is very cheap, does not provide  real-time data during a crisis, and usually has an excessively large revisit  cycle [4]. The data collection on the field is usually too costly  and alarming as it needs to examine the area  of disaster.  This time, the social media platform offers a useful substitute source of  information. Flood-affected areas of People often share images describing the  situation.  The most significant advantage of this data is that it is readily available in  real-time, directly from the flooded region, and it is also quite inexpensive. The main drawback is that to extract useful information  from the image, it must be correctly processed. No one method has been proposed yet  that retrive automatically floods information from social media images.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We aim to close this gap in this research by introducing  proposed a deep learning framework, Mask R-CNN for flood-water level estimation  based on images. Estimating flood levels from the image is a challenging task. The primary  challenge arises from the potential instability of water levels, as they can  vary across different areas captured within an image. To address this issue, we analyze each distinct object in  the image individually, estimating the extent to which each is submerged in  water.  If we know the approximate knowledge of the different objects' heights, the  water level can then be roughly estimated.  However, examining each object separately uncovers more difficulties: i) the  objects are partially visible or submerged in water; ii) it is impossible to  determine the exact size of the objects. Recognizing objects, even when they are  only partially visible, is crucial, as they provide valuable information about  the water level. Fortunately, deep learning models,  like the one we employ, can detect objects even when they are only partially  visible.  To overcome the second challenge, we search for certain things that are similar  in both, making them likely to show up in the images, and whose size is  approximately consistent throughout all occurrences. This approach allows us to  determine the water level relative to each object and make a comprehensive  overall estimate.<span></span></div><div>The main goal of this  paper is to contribute to the development of such a system by showing how image-based  sensing and detection techniques could be utilized to detect flood levels based  on the object present in the image. In this paper, we proposed the Mask R-CNN  model for the estimation of flood water levels. Mask R-CNN is built on a Faster  R-CNN algorithm and improves the segmentation performance. The implementation  of Mask R-CNN on detecting floodwater has not been done previously. Next, we estimate the amount of water submerged in the  objects that fall into particular categories using the Faster-RCNN algorithm  once more. Once the network architecture has been established, we create a  dataset by adding flood-water level information to images, which we then use to  train our network. Next, we assess the suggested model to demonstrate its  efficacy in estimating the water level of objects in images.<span></span></div><div>The remainder of this paper is  organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of existing research on water  level estimation and flood prediction technologies. Section 3 details the  methodology, including data acquisition, model selection, and implementation.  In Section 4, we discuss our experimental results and evaluate the model's  performance. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the implications  of our findings, as well as potential directions for future research to further  enhance water level estimation capabilities.<span></span></div>
