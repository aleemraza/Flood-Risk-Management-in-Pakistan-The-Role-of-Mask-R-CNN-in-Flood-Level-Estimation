<div><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Conclusion</b></div><div><b></b><b>&nbsp;</b>In this study, we  addressed the significance of automatic disaster management systems as well as  their difficulties, as specifically used to floods. Using a deep learning  framework, we developed a model in this paper that uses images gathered from  social media platforms to predict the flood water level, and this model is based  on the Mask R-CNN architecture. When a specific object is detected, our  suggested model not only fast segmentation but and same time the predicts water  level. We plan to enhance our architecture to better utilize textual data in  the feature. In actuality, images shared on social networking sites frequently  have text attached that discusses the image's veracity. The realization is that  we can increase the prediction's accuracy even further if we can integrate  these two connected pieces of information.<span></span></div>
