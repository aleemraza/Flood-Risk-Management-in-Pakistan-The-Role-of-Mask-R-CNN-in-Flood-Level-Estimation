<div><b>3.3. Model training and loss Function</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b>For the experimental study, we utilized a pre-trained Mask  R-CNN model.  These experiments were performed on a personal laptop equipped with Intel  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8365U CPU @ 3.40GHz and Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 through Anaconda  Jupyter notebook and Kaggle notebook also used. In this paper, we propose a  deep-learning approach for flood-water level estimation. We used pertained Mask  R-CNN as the base architecture which is the best and easiest solution for instance  image segmentation. Figure 2 shows the overall diagram of the method.<span></span></div>
