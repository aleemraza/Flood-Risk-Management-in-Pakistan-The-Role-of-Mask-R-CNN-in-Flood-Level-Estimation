<div><b>4. Mask R-CNN Model Training and  Validations loss Curve</b></div><div><b></b>The above Figure 3 shows the training and validation loss  curves for a Mask R-CNN model implemented for water level estimation. In Figure 3 each  subplot explained the performance of different components of the Mask R-CNN  model on 70 epochs. In the figure, over loss curve shows a steady decrease in  training loss, which shows effective learning.  Nevertheless, the validation loss, following an initial decline, reaches an  endpoint and experiences a tiny increase, indicating the possibility of  overfitting. This tendency is a frequent indicator that the model is  remembering the training data instead of accurately making inferences from new  data. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) classification loss plot shows that the  training loss reduces substantially and becomes stable quickly, however, the  validation loss swings and does not continuously decline. This fluctuation  suggests that the model's ability to discriminate between object and non-object  areas is unreliable with further information. Likewise, the RPN box loss curve  indicates a gradual reduction in training loss, but the validation loss stays  large and varied, indicating the difficulty in reliably anticipating bounding  boxes for unknown data. Both "the Mask R-CNN classification and box loss  curves"&nbsp;indicate diminishing training loss trends, indicating that  the model's predicted class and predicted&nbsp;bounding box for identified  objects are becoming more accurate. However, the validation losses for such  variables are more unpredictable and do not show the same continuous decline,  implying overfitting or probable noise in the validation data. Consequently, a  distinct declining trend in training loss is shown in the mask loss plot, which  is essential for accurate division like water level estimation. However, the  validation loss shows variations and does not follow an even curve, indicating  that the model's segmentation performance on fresh data might be improved.  As a whole, while the training curves show excellent  learning, the unpredictability, and larger values in the validation losses  indicate that the model might benefit from improved generalization Procedures.  Regularization methods, data augmentation, and getting a more diverse and  representative validation set might all be used to assure robust performance  across many circumstances. By thoroughly examining these loss curves, we get  significant insights into the Mask R-CNN model's training mechanics and  pinpoint particular areas for further development [10]. Addressing these  challenges will be critical to increasing the model's accuracy and dependability  in predicting water levels and, as a result, more active monitoring and  management of water resources.</div>
