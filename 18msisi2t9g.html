<div><b>4.1. Precision/recall curves</b></div><div><b></b><b>&nbsp;</b>The precision-recall curve for the Mask R-CNN model used to  water level estimate is shown in Fig 4 above, with an Average Precision (AP) at  the IoU threshold of 0.50 (AP@50=0.500). This curve is critical when measuring  the model's performance in terms of accuracy and recall at various threshold  settings. When recall is the lowest point the precision-recall curve begins at  1.0, showing that the model delivers highly accurate predictions with few true  positives. However, when recollection grows, accuracy decreases dramatically.  This indicates that, while the model is capable of high precision, maintaining  that precision becomes more difficult as it seeks to extract more true  positives. The sharp decrease in accuracy points out that the model may  struggle with false positives as the recall rate rises. An AP@50 of 0.500 shows  that the model performs moderately in terms of precision and recall. This  measure integrates accuracy and recall into a single value, which represents  the area under the precision-recall curve. A result of 0.500 indicates that the  model achieves a reasonable balance of accuracy and recall at the IoU threshold  of 0.50, but there is still potential for enhancement. The significant dip in  the curve indicates possible areas for improvement. Improving the model's  capacity to sustain better precision at higher recall levels may require  polishing the training data, improving the model architecture, or using  sophisticated approaches such as hard negative mining. These techniques might  assist achieve a more appropriate precision-recall bond, which is critical for  accurate water level measurement. Ultimately, while the Mask R-CNN model  performs rather well with an AP@50 of 0.500, more tweaks and optimizations are  required to improve its precision-recall balance, thereby increasing the  model's usefulness in real-world water level determine tasks.</div>
