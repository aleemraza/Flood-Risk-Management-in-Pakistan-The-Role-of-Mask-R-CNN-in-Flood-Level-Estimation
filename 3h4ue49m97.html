<div><b></b>Figure 6 is used for demonstrating the  qualitative analysis of the Mask R-CNN model's performance on water level  estimation: the original image and the detection result. The Mask R-CNN model  successfully detects and classifies water level demonstrating its ability in  real work scenarios. The Original Figure 6 shows a flood scene with individuals  navigating through the water, and this figure is used to identify the  performance and model detection accuracy. In the detection, the Mask R-CNN model efficiently detected and segmented  the different regions with marked water  level colored with bounding boxes and labels. The model correctly  recognizes multiple individuals and allocates appropriate water level labels to  each detected region. For example, the person on the left is accurately labeled  as level 3 with a high confidence score of 0.998, while and person in the  middle carrying a child is labeled as level 4 with a confidence score of 0.999.  The model's strong certainty in its predictions is indicated  by the high confidence scores for every detected region. This implies that the  model has been properly trained to discriminate between various water levels.  The segmentation masks show how effectively the model works  for accurate localization and segmentation of water levels because they match  the borders of the identified locations.</div>
