<div><b>4.2. Confusion matrix</b></div><div><b></b><b>&nbsp;</b>The  provided confusion matrix in Figure 5 shows an extensive description of the  Mask R-CNN model's performance in water level estimates at various levels. Each  cell in the matrix denotes the number of times the real water level (rows) was  forecasted as a distinct water level (columns). The diagonal components represent  accurate predictions, but the off-diagonal components represent  misclassifications. Correct forecasts of diagonal  components have the largest count, demonstrating the model accurately predicts  water levels in a broad range of situations. However, there are considerable  off-diagonal components, indicating that there is still opportunity for  development at some levels. The  background class (bg) contains several misclassifications, resulting in  inaccurate predictions for multiple water levels. This shows that the model has  trouble distinguishing between background and real water level classes. Levels  3, 5, and 9 exhibit enhanced performance with higher correct predictions.  However, levels 0, 1, and 2 exhibit greater misclassification rates, indicating  that the algorithm struggles to reliably anticipate these precise water levels.  A brief review of the model's accuracy at each level is provided in the summary  row at the bottom. Level 3's accuracy is 77.14%, whereas level 5's accuracy is  81.82%. These numbers imply that although the model works well at some levels,  total accuracy differs at other levels. The  model's performance may be enhanced in the areas indicated by the matrix. The  model's overall performance would be improved, for example, by decreasing misclassifications  in the background class and increasing accuracy at levels with lower correct  prediction rates. We may learn more about the unique  advantages and disadvantages of the Mask R-CNN model for water level estimate  by examining the confusion matrix. This comprehensive review aids in revealing  areas that require focused enhancements, such as improving feature extraction  strategies, honing training data quality, or putting in place more advanced  post-processing procedures. Enhancing these elements will be essential to  obtain more precision and dependability in water level estimates, which will  eventually help to improve water resource monitoring and management.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
